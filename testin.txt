he idea of ingesting a Tide Pod used to be a little bit funny.
For example, when The New York Daily News printed a comment from Senator Chuck Schumer under a rudely ageist headline in September 2012. He had recently been informed that 40 children in New York City had eaten Tide Pods and received medical attention for eating Tide Pods in the preceding five months. And he said, mostly unprovoked, “I saw one on my staffer’s desk and I wanted to eat it.” It’s good in print and it’s better out loud. “I saw one on my staffer’s desk and I wanted to eat it.”
Very funny! Especially if you’re familiar with and entertained by Chuck Schumer’s general countenance and mannerisms, which — as a regular attendee of the Labor Day parade in Crown Heights, where it is so cheap and easy to become drunk in the sun — I am. Haha, Chuck. I know you were talking about a serious problem, so I’m sorry for being glib, but at the same time, why on earth did you say that? Makes me laugh. he
