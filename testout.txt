the idea of ingesting a tide pod used to be a little bit funny
for example when the new york daily news printed a comment from senator chuck schumer under a rudely ageist headline in september 2012 he had recently been informed that 40 children in new york city had eaten tide pods and received medical attention for eating tide pods in the preceding five months and he said mostly unprovoked i saw one on my staffers desk and i wanted to eat it its good in print and its better out loud i saw one on my staffers desk and i wanted to eat it
very funny especially if youre familiar with and entertained by chuck schumers general countenance and mannerisms which as a regular attendee of the labor day parade in crown heights where it is so cheap and easy to become drunk in the sun i am haha chuck i know you were talking a serious problem so im sorry for being glib but at the same time why on earth did you say that makes me laugh
