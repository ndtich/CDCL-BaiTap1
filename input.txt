One of the more interesting features of Google Home devices is the ability to make phone calls by simply asking Google. This feature has been available in the United States for several months now and the UK is the second market to get the feature.
All you have to do is say “Hey, Google, Call Dave” or “Call Mum”. If you’ve never placed a call with Google Home in the past, your device will tell you to go into the Home app and set up voice calling.
Once you confirm your phone number, you’ll get an SMS to confirm that you are the owner of the phone number. This is so when you make a hands-free call, your friends and family will see your phone number in the Caller ID.
Of course, if you have multiple people in your household, Google Home won’t let just anyone make calls. It supports multiple users so when your partner calls their brother Dave, Google won’t call your crazy co-worker Dave.
The feature is rolling out to users in the UK over the next week so do be patient if you don’t get it right away. It might also be a good idea to check that you have the latest version of the Google Home app installed.
In celebration of Mother’s Day in the UK (which is March 11), Google is running a promotion so you can get the Google Home Mini for £10-off from either the Google Store, Currys PC World, John Lewis, or Argos.
